Reviewed Python fundamentals as well as Pandas and NumPy; 
Installed all necessary libraries and completed setup; 
Obtained NewsAPI credentials from newsapi.org; 
Understood NLP fundamentals; 
Understood and ran the notebooks given for Week-1 Pro Challenges 
Read and understand BERT architecture and its components; 
Completed Tasks 1 and 2 aiding in understanding of the 80-10-10 Masking Rule and Next Sentence Prediction(NSP); 
Understood and researched about FINBERT and Hugging Face implementation; 
Wrote and debugged a program taking a long document that chunks it into 512-token segments and returns the average sentiment as part of the Week-2 challenge(added as a notebook);
Implemented a sequence-based LSTM architecture to model temporal dependencies in financial time series using a sliding window approach, enabling next-day return prediction from historical market data;
Integrated transformer-based financial sentiment (FinBERT) with numerical price indicators, combining semantic news signals and technical momentum within a unified prediction pipeline;
Designed and applied a sentiment-weighted trading decision rule, converting raw LSTM forecasts into interpretable BUY / SELL / HOLD signals by enforcing agreement between predicted returns and market sentiment;
Developed a modular end-to-end pipeline that fetches real OHLCV data, processes financial news via NewsAPI, performs sentiment aggregation, runs sequence inference, and generates a final stock-level trading report;
Ensured architectural consistency and reproducibility by saving and loading trained model weights, validating the full integration from data ingestion to decision-making;
